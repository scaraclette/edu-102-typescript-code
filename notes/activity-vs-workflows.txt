# Activity vs Workflows
Diagram explanation: Activity to read some data. We want to modify the data and return it.
Questions:
- Should transformations be done in workflow or activity?
    - No because every activity result is different data. So potentially, 
      the transformation itself to the activity result is never the same between workflows.
- What is best practice to handle expired activity results?
    - Clarification: If an activity frequently retrieves data that is modified elsewhere,
    what is best way to handle this?
